## A Linguistic Approach to Microservices
*Speaker*: Claudio Guidi

### Abstract
Microservices are usually considered the be technology agnostic, thus they are approached in terms of architectures or models to be applied on distributed systems. Nevertheless, their basic mechanisms can be crystallized within a unique programming language by offering a new mindset for developers and engineers, In the past years we dealt with such an objective starting from the theoretical foundations of service oriented computing. In this presentation I'll show our experience and our results in approaching microservices with a specific programming language called Jolie.
