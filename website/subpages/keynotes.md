## A Linguistic Approach to Microservices
Speaker: *Claudio Guidi* <span class="text-muted">@ italianaSoftware</span>

### Abstract
Microservices are usually considered the be technology agnostic, thus they are approached in terms of architectures or models to be applied on distributed systems. Nevertheless, their basic mechanisms can be crystallized within a unique programming language by offering a new mindset for developers and engineers, In the past years we dealt with such an objective starting from the theoretical foundations of service oriented computing. In this presentation I'll show our experience and our results in approaching microservices with a specific programming language called Jolie.

## The problem with Microservices
Speaker: *Steve Ross-Talbot* <span class="text-muted">@ Estafet</span>

### Abstract
Are microservices really the next Big Thing? Whilst they currently dominate conferences and the language of product vendors - often linked to APIs, Continuous Delivery, Containers and PaaS - the deluge of information often confuses rather than clarifies. This has led to sub-optimal microservices architectures and some spectacular failures.

In this talk, we will discuss both data-centric and interaction-centric approaches, looking at what happens when people “code-first-and-ask-questions-later”. How much up-front thinking do you need?, and how can you exert sufficient control over implementations once they are live? The future may well include policy-driven microservices architecture, but you need to ask some tough questions now if you are going to deliver to the business on a continued and scaled basis.
