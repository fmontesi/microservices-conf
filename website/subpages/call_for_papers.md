## Preparation of submissions

We solicit contributions on (add list of topics) in the form of extended abstracts with a maximum length of two pages. As common for workshops, talks may be based not only on work that is published or submitted for publication, but also describing work in progress.
Accepted publications will be collected in an informal book of abstracts, which will be distributed at the event.

Microservices 2017 will employ a lightweight reviewing process, as described below.

**Deadline**: The deadline for submissions is XXX, XXX 00, 2017, [Anywhere on Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth). This deadline will be strictly enforced.

**Formatting**: Submissions must be in PDF format, printable in black and white on A4 paper, and interpretable by common PDF tools. All submissions must be prepared using the LaTeX system using the Easychair document class (missing link).

**Citations**: (lcf would simply remove this) Microservices 2017 papers are expected to use author-year citations for references to other work. Author-year citations may be used as either a noun phrase, such as "The lambda calculus was originally conceived by Church (1932)", or a parenthetic phrase, such as "The lambda calculus (Church 1932) was intended as a foundation for mathematics". A useful test for correct usage is to make sure that the text still reads correctly when the parenthesized portions of any references are omitted. Take care with prepositions; in the first example above, "by" is more appropriate than "in" because it allows the text to be read correctly as a reference to the author. Sometimes, readability may be improved by putting parenthetic citations at the end of a clause or a sentence, such as "A foundation for mathematics was provided by the lambda calculus (Church 1932)". In LaTeX, use `\citet{Church-1932}` for citations as a noun phrase, "Church (1932)", and `\citep{Church-1932}` for citations as a parenthetic phrase, "(Church 1932)"; for details, see Sections 2.3â€“2.5 of the natbib documentation ([http://ctan.org/pkg/natbib](http://ctan.org/pkg/natbib)).

**Submission**: Submissions will be accepted at XXX.  Improved versions of a paper may be submitted at any point before the submission deadline using the same web interface.

**Post-proceedings**: Depending on the success of this initiative, we are considering the publication of a volume of post-proceedings, for which there will be a separate call for papers.  In this way, the interested authors will have a chance to enrich their contributions according to the feedback they received during the workshop.

Please contact the program chair if you have questions or are concerned about the appropriateness of a topic.
