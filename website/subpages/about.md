Microservices is a forum for the discussion of all aspects of designing and programming microservice architectures. Both theoretical and experimental contributions are welcome, on topics ranging from formal frameworks to industrial experience reports.

Microservices 2017 seeks presentations on the design and implementation of microservice architectures. Submissions are invited on all topics from principles to practice, from foundations to features, and from abstraction to application. The scope includes all technologies that support design, development, and deployment of microservice architectures.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

*   **Language Design**: concurrency, parallelism, and distribution; modules; components and composition; metaprogramming; type systems; interoperability; domain-specific languages.

*   **Implementation**: virtual machines; containerisation; routing; multi-threading; exploiting parallel hardware; interfaces to foreign functions, services, components, or low-level machine resources.

*   **Software-Development Techniques**: algorithms and data structures; design patterns; specification; verification; validation; debugging; testing; tracing; profiling.

*   **Foundations**: formal semantics; type theory; control; state; effects; program verification; dependent types.

*   **Analysis and Transformation**: control-flow; data-flow; abstract interpretation; partial evaluation; program calculation.

*   **Applications**: formal-methods tools; artificial intelligence; systems programming; distributed-systems and web programming; databases; data-format processing; scientific and numerical computing; scripting; system administration; security.

Presentations will be selected based on an extended abstract (two pages). See the call for papers for details.
